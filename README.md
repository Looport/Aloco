# Starting Point

The First step, as always, is to install dependencies.
Run these commands one by one in your terminal.

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

brew install nvm
nvm install 21

npm i
```
<br />
The second step is to install environment services with which the application will interact.

```shell
# Install Docker and Docker Compose where our services will be run
brew install --cask docker && brew install docker-compose

# Deploy Surreal DB in development mode
make deploy-dev-surrealdb

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Run migration that will prepare database
make db-build
make db-migrate
```

<br />

The last step is to start the application in development mode.

```shell
npm run dev
```

# Deployment

```shell
# Build and Push docker images
make build && make push

# Connect to the server via ssh or any other way that recommended by your hosting provider
ssh root@<server_ip>

# Clone repository
git clone <repository>

# Pull and Run docker images
make pull && make deploy-prod
```
